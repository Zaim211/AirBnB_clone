# AirBnB_clone
Project Description

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project involves building a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects and serves as the first step towards creating a full web application. The command interpreter allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects related to AirBnB properties.

COMMAND INTERPRETER:

The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.
This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can  interact with the backend which was developed with Python OOP Programming.
In our case, We want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
•Show
•Create
•Update
•Count
•Destroy

As part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with backend and file storage system, the following actions can be performed:
•Retrieve an object from a file, database and etc...
•Do operations on an objects(count,computer stats and etc...)
•Update attributes of an object
•Create new objects (eg, A New User or a new Place)
•Destroy an object
Installing:

 

You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies.
